# Rows

This type of module is really geared towards presenting different tariffs to users although you can use it for any content that fits.

It is formatted in rows \(_rows_\) where each row has several optional fields such as a small tag that acts as a title for that row, a short text and its corresponding link.

Fill in the required fields and decide if you need to fill in any of the optional fields:

## Details

**Name**. Name that internally identifies the element. It is never shown in the app but you can use this name to identify the module in the module list view.â€Œ

â€‹ðŸ”… It has no maximum length and is a **required** field.â€Œ

**For more information check the guidelines**. Check the design guidelines relating to the module you are creating or editing. Review them to ensure that content of the highest possible quality is being uploaded.

**Row 1 Action Url**. URL of the row, i.e., the URL that can be accessed by clicking on the row.

**Card Ending date and time**. Date and time you want the _row_ to stop being displayed to users.

**Display the ending date on the card**. Activate this option to inform the user that the content will expire.

**How is the expiration date displayed?**

If you have enabled the option to show the expiration date, the way in which that date is displayed depends on the day on which the _card_ expires.

`ENDS TODAY hh:mm AM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm PM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm` \(format varies depending on the country\) to indicate that _card_ expires on the same day at the specified time, in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively. For example, `ENDS TODAY at 9:00 AM`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image-31.png)

`TOMORROW` indicates that the expiration date is the following day.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image-6.png)

`ENDS on dd mm` to indicate that the difference is more than two days. For example `ENDS on 30 JUN`.

ðŸŽ¯ Starting and Ending date and time is a way to program some campaigns and is specifically designed for seasonal campaigns.

**Card 1 Micro-segments**. Tags that you can add, always separated by commas, to make a segmentation of the users who are going to see the content you are creating.

ðŸ”… It is an **optional** field.

**Card 1 categories \(mandatory\)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format \(as opposed to having to scroll horizontally\), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_divices-1.png)

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories.png)

* **Accessories**: earphones, cases, watches.
* **Bundles**: packs, plans, product packs.
* **Devices**: smartphones, tablets.
* **Loyalty**: membership, loyalty/retention programmes content \(Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.\)
* **Promos**: promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
* **Plans**: rates, plan upgrades.
* **Services**: added value services, apps, new app features, other TEF services.
* **TV**: television plans, content packs, featured or new content.

{% hint style="info" %}
The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**.
{% endhint %}

ðŸŽ¯ **Good practices**: We don't recommend assigning more than one category to a content. Explore CMS does not set a limit for the number of categories that can be assigned.

**What should I consider when using the categories?**

Consult the [**Categories**](../../faq_en-us.md#categories) section of the [FAQ](../../faq_en-us.md) to resolve all of your doubts.
