# Vertical Cards

This type of module is used to display several elements in vertical format. It is very useful for presenting products offers, for example.

It is displayed as a carousel offering links on each _card_ as well as optional elements like a tag on the image or a link to an entire list \(a "See all"\).

**How is the expiration date displayed?**

If you have enabled the option to show the expiration date, the way in which that date is displayed depends on the day on which the _card_ expires.

`ENDS TODAY hh:mm AM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm PM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm` \(format varies depending on the country\) to indicate that _card_ expires on the same day at the specified time, in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively. For example, `ENDS TODAY at 9:00 AM`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image-49.png)

`TOMORROW` indicates that the expiration date is the following day.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image-6.png)

`ENDS on dd mm` to indicate that the difference is more than two days. For example `ENDS on 30 JUN`.

🎯 Starting and Ending date and time is a way to program some campaigns and is specifically designed for seasonal campaigns.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember that you have to configure a minimum of 2 cards and a maximum of 6.

The fields for all the cards are the same.
{% endhint %}

**Card 1 categories \(mandatory\)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format \(as opposed to having to scroll horizontally\), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_divices-1.png)

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories.png)

* **Accessories**: earphones, cases, watches.
* **Devices**: smartphones, tablets.
* **O2 Priority**: membership, loyalty/retention programmes content \(Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.\)
* **Promotions**: promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
* **Perks**: rates, plan upgrades.
* **O2 Extra's**: added value services, apps, new app features, other TEF services.

{% hint style="info" %}
The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**.
{% endhint %}

🎯 **Good practices**: We don't recommend assigning more than one category to a content. Explore CMS does not set a limit for the number of categories that can be assigned.

**What should I consider when using the categories?**

Consult the [**Categories**](../../faq_en-us.md#categories) section of the [FAQ](../../faq_en-us.md) to resolve all of your doubts.

### Change the order of the _cards_

Inside the module, you can move the cards to change the order in which they are displayed.
