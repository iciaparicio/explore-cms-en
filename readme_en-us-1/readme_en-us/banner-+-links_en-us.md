# Banner + links

_Banner_ modules simply contain an image or a _bumper_ with a link.

💡 **Did you know?**

A _bumper_ is a short video or animation. It is a fairly standard format used in marketing, usually used for commercial purposes and with an average duration of around 6 seconds.

**For more information check the guidelines**. Check the design guidelines relating to the module you are creating or editing. Review them to ensure that content of the highest possible quality is being uploaded.

### Banner

For each _banner_, the available fields will vary depending on whether you select an image or a _bumper_:

When the image has been uploaded it is previewed just below.

To upload a bumper you have two options:

2. Display the list of _bumpers_ and select one of those that have already been uploaded.

Activate the **Play in loop** option ifor the _bumper_ to be played in loop in Explore. If you leave it off, it will play every time the _bumper_ is on the screen, but once it has finished it will stop.

When the _bumper_ has been uploaded it is previewed just below:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image-71.png)

You can choose to add links at the bottom of the _banner_. In order to do so, fill in the following fields for each link you want to add \(up to a maximum of 5 links\):

**Name**. Name of the link \(for example `Benefits`\).

🔅 It has a maximum length of **38 characters** and is a **required** field.

**Action. URL** that opens when you click on the **Name**, i.e., on the name of the link.

🔅 This is a required field and has to be a valid URL \(for example: [`https://www.google.com`](https://www.google.com)\)

**Card 1 categories \(mandatory\)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format \(as opposed to having to scroll horizontally\), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories_divices-1.png)

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/categories.png)

* **Accessories**: earphones, cases, watches.
* **Devices**: smartphones, tablets.
* **O2 Priority**: membership, loyalty/retention programmes content \(Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.\)
* **Promotions**: promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
* **Perks**: rates, plan upgrades.
* **O2 Extra's**: added value services, apps, new app features, other TEF services.

{% hint style="info" %}
The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**.
{% endhint %}

🎯 **Good practices**: We don't recommend assigning more than one category to a content. Explore CMS does not set a limit for the number of categories that can be assigned.

**What should I consider when using the categories?**

Consult the [**Categories**](../../faq_en-us.md#categories) section of the [FAQ](../../faq_en-us.md) to resolve all of your doubts.
