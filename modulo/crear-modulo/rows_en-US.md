# Rows

This type of module is really geared towards presenting different tariffs to users although you can use it for any content that fits.

It is formatted in rows \(_rows_\) where each row has several optional fields such as a small tag that acts as a title for that row, a short text and its corresponding link.

**How is the expiration date displayed?** 

If you have enabled the option to show the expiration date, the way in which that date is displayed depends on the day on which the _card_ expires.

`ENDS TODAY hh:mm AM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm PM` or `ENDS TODAY hh:mm` \(format varies depending on the country\) to indicate that _card_ expires on the same day at the specified time, in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively. For example, `ENDS TODAY at 9:00 AM`.

`TOMORROW` indicates that the expiration date is the following day.

`ENDS on dd mm` to indicate that the difference is more than two days. For example `ENDS on 30 JUN`.
